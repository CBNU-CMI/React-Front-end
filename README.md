## Development

### Using Dev API Locally

You must clone and run [`Alrimi Server`](https://github.com/CBNU-CMI/cbnu-alrimi-server) on your local machine in dev mode.

```zsh
npm run dev
```

### Using Production API

Also you can develop only the client application without cloning server repository [`Alrimi Server`](https://github.com/CBNU-CMI/cbnu-alrimi-server).

```zsh
npm run start
```

### ðŸ”Œ Components

**`Layout`**


**`Dialog`**

**`Modal`**

**Props**

- `children`: A wrapper element.
- `strategy`: This method is being called when the bottom of the container reaches the end of a viewport. It returns `true` when there are more content to be loaded, `false` on the other hand.

**`Calendar`**

By including this component inside render function, you can hide the `GlobalFooter` which will be appended to every page globally.

**`WhiteBody`**

Set body background to pure W/B(`#ffffff`, `#000000` on dark mode). Usually use this when the content is not displayed inside blocks.

**`EodiroLink`**

### String Utils

**`camelToKebab(str)`**

Transform a `camelCase` string to `kebab-case`.
